# integration-test-flutter-app

The integration tests are added to root/integration_test

Since, there were no instructions on which integrations to consider, I took my reference from pages 
directory under lib/presentation

The scenarios considered are mentioned below 

1. No album state ( First Time User Experience) 
2. Search for album 
3. Album details 
4. Add album to favorites 
5. Remove albun from favorites 
6. delete album
7. Home Page to fetch album
